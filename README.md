## Description
DrinkUpp is an application where users can get different information for cocktails. The main feature is that a user can type in an ingredient and see all the drinks that contain that ingredient. The user story is that a person has a particular ingredient and would like to know what drinks they could make with it. They can type in mint and will be presented with drinks such as a mint julep or a mojito. Then the user is provided buttons to provide information on how to make the drink. Another feature included was the ability to be presented with a page of random drinks.
