DrinkUpp

DrinkUpp is an application where users can get different information for cocktails. The main feature is that a user can type in an ingredient and see all the drinks that contain that ingredient.

Our user story is that a person has a particular ingredient and would like to know what drinks they could make with it. They can type in mint and will be presented with drinks such as a mint julip or a mojito. Then the user is provided buttons to provide information on how to make the drink. Another feature we included was the ability to be presented with a page of random drinks. Our motivation for developing this app was to create a fun application a user could enjoy. If the application proved to become popular and spread, ads and premium features users pay for could be added to generate revenue. 

The coding languages we used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. We used a framework called Materialize to create a responsive front end. We gathered our drink data from an API named TheCocktailDB. It is a large database of drinks complete with their names, descriptions, pictures, instructions, and more. We fetched data from three different API calls, to display the relevant drink information. The first call is used when a user searches for a drink by ingredient. Once that call is made, we had the drink ID, which we then passed into another call to get details about the drink. Our third call was separate and was used to gather random drinks from the database. We used GitHub for our version control amongst our team. In order to ensure that a team member did not implement code that broke the main program, we utilized GitHub branches so that we could all commit, but only when a solution was agreed upon it would be pushed to the main.

The roles we assigned were based on our team membersâ€™ particular strengths. Some of us were better at styling and CSS, while others focused more on the code functionality. We selected a team leader to oversee the project, and then the other two members had the roles of assisting and following through on code and design implementations. We followed agile methodology to develop the program. We met every day and planned new features for us each to work on. We would each design, attempt to implement, and test our features before meeting with the group again to discuss whether the change should be kept, worked on more, or discarded.

 Some of the challenges we faced were getting our GitHub branches worked out. There were issues merging with the main when some members tried to push when files had been changed or removed. We had styling issues with our Materialize framework and how it placed items on the page. Another problem we ran into was implementing modals and removing data from those modals before additional information was displayed. 

In the end our success was that we were able to create a program that did exactly what we intended it to do. When the program is used, a user types in an ingredient and are displayed a list of cocktails to make. We completed our tasks ahead of schedule and were able to utilize our extra time to add additional functionality. 
In the future if we were to develop this application further, we would create it in an app environment so people could use it on their phone. We would make it so that users can enter multiple ingredients, and only be displayed drinks that have all the ingredients they want to use. We would also add more features that might provide the user additional entertainment.
